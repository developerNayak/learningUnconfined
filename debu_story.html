                    <p> Dusk had fallen and after spending a day outside, Debu walked back home, like always, a retreat back was a gargantuan task for him, as he knew what is to come, his mother would open the door with quizzical expressions on her face and on one corner of the room father would be seated, smoking his cigarette, and reading a news paper giving him an indignant welcome look. The sister would pass across the room with resentment in her eyes and in some corner of the house would be sitting his wife with an infant child in her arms. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Debobroto Das Alias Debu was the son of Mr. Prassana Das and Smriti Das and brother of Madulika Das (who was unmarried) and, not to forget husband of Arundhati. Mr. Das had long time retired from the Department of Posts as a Post master and he was the sole bread winner of the family with his paltry pension amount. 
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>During the past couple of years Debu had been scouting for a job in Kolkata but luck always evaded him and owning to recession he was unable to establish himself in some decent job. For last few months Debu had given up looking for jobs and had started to stay home.
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>He might have stayed home for about a month and hell came crashing on him. He realized that his sister was anguished towards him because she thought that his unemployment is the primary factor for her staying single, had he been earning he would have fulfilled his responsibility of getting her married in an untarnished household. His father gave a disgruntled gaze were ever he went. Wife appeared quite dejected and mother looked worried about him so the combination of everything made situation quite murkier for poor Debu. After having been through that unsaid and inexplicable torture Debu decided to leave house early in the morning on the pretext of finding a job and come back late in the evening, that would at least keep him out of firing range for a while, while leaving he would ask for some meager amount from his mother which his mother would give but after a lot of coaxing.</p>
                    <p>
                      Debu and folks stayed in a place called Baguihati in Kolkata; from there he would walk down to Belaghachia metro station which is good 4-5 kilometers from Baguihati he would take a metro to Esplanade. Being a business centre he loved to gallivant in Esplande and Dalhousie, as it would give him a false feel of being employed. After wandering on the streets of Esplande he would go to the park adjacent to Eden Garden stadium where he would sit under a shade of a tree, read a book, quietly eat his lunch and many a times go off to sleep. This he would follow when he needed some solitude or just wanted to be with his own self. Debu was an intellectually a very deep person and his knowledge on different worldly issues was exemplary, besides this he was blessed with excellent communication skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      During then unemployment was at its pinnacle in the whole country and Kolkata was no exception. Unemployed youth would lounge around or dilly dally at various tea stalls and confab, which they call Adda Marna in colloquial terms , even Debu had a band of unemployed friends, alternatively, he would join his friends who belonged to the milieu of hoi polloi, at Rehmaan chacha’s tea stall in a squalor near Kankurgachi. Rehmaan chacha’s tea stall was quite decrepit with a few rickety chairs, he had no money to spare for the repairs, and he would serve tea in clay pottery locally called as bhaar. After the tea it was customary to smoke, and one cigarette was shared by two at times even three as the stock of cigarettes used to be limited, and so was the money in the pockets to replenish the stock. The process of sharing a cigarette was called ‘counter’.  These tea stalls are the best exemplars of hope to the hopeless and, I personally salute the spirits of those unemployed youth, despite being jobless, having quagmire in life, frugal sum of money in the pocket, and to top it all unappeasable family members, still, they would leave no stone unturned in cracking jokes at each other and laughing heartily and merrily, but under their travesty and frivolity lies a stratum which is nothing more than a vacuum, void, desolation……

                    <p>
                      Though, Debu was quite close to all the boys in the troop of unemployed friends but he had a special affinity for Anirbaan. Anirbaan dwelling was close to Rehmaan chacha’s tea stall. His father Ashish Ray, like Debu’s father had retired from a Government job and even after his retirement he was obligated to work as he had to feed a few clamoring mouths. Ashish Ray was working in a small mill in the out skirts of Kolkata and combination of his salary and his pension somehow made the two ends meet. Anirbaan’s quandary was no different from Debu’s, rather, it was even worse, but still, he managed to wear that pleasant smile on his face and appeared unperturbed by the upheavals of life and living, he was a bomb packed with laughter and playfulness. Occasionally, he would get upset following some nasty brawl at home but his resilience would make him bounce back almost instantly. On many occasions both, Debu and Anirbaan would go to a nearby park in Phoolbagan, sit there and pour their hearts out to relieve the internal squall. Somehow, Debu liked spending time with Anirbaan because whenever he would feel hopeless and pessimistic, Anirbaan would brim him with hope. Anirbaan loved quoting famous people and whenever Debu would be hopeless he would say “Before something great happens everything falls apart” and that would fill Debu with positive energy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Like always, Debu headed towards Rehmaan Chacha’s tea stall in the morning. Rehmaan chacha had not opened his stall and he appeared gleam and doleful. Debu walked up to him with an air of uncertainty, and asked Rehmaan chacha whether all was well. To which Rehmaan chacha said in trembling voice “Anirbaan is no more” and he broke down incessantly. Hearing this, rug swept out under Debu’s feet. The same morning following an altercation with his father Anirbaan had gone on a diazepam overdose and had succumbed to it. Debu was shattered beyond words. Five minutes’ walk to Anirbaan’s home felt five miles long tread. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Debu, with great effort dragged himself into the house and what he saw made him absolutely numb and lifeless. The atmosphere was funereal his mother was crying inconsolably and on the floor of one corner of the house sat his father with his hand on his head and repeatedly saying with remorse “I killed my son”. Somehow, deep within Debu knew it was not Anirbaan’s father who killed him, rather it were the circumstances which lead to this woe, as we are mere puppets in the hands of them. This was the first time Debu saw life knuckling down before death owning to infelicitous circumstances. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After the demise of his dear friend life was, and was not, the same for poor Debu. Life could have been deemed the same outwardly as he continued to leave his house early in the morning and come back late in the evening, but internally the void could not be repleted and he was more than broken and in fragments. He had virtually stopped going to the Adda and preferred isolation and he started to frequent the park near Eden Garden. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One fine day as usual Debu was travelling in a metro rail to Esplanade when a gentleman boarded the train at Shyam Bazaar (which was next to the station from where Debu use to board the train) and sat next to Debu, Debu was engrossed in a book, the gentleman curiously asked whether what book was he reading and the conversation was struck. The gentleman introduced himself as Partho Banerjee; he was working with a tea company at Chowringee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thereafter, Partho and Debu frequently met each other on their metro rail rides and then, one day, Partho casually enquired about Debu’s job to which Debu sheepishly answered that he doesn’t have one. Partho was quite stunned to hear that as he was reconciled to the fact that Debu was employed and used to ply to his office by the morning metro. Merely two days would have passed when Partho met Debu on the metro rail and asked him whether; he would be interested in joining his company’s marketing department. Debu could not believe his ears, it was like his silent prayers being answered, Debu could falteringly answer in a small “yes”. Partho told Debu that he would schedule his interview after a week and in the mean time he can prepare himself for the interview, to which Debu nodded his head obediently.  The week flew past and the day dawned when he was to appear for the interview.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Debu was dressed immaculately for the interview and he reached the office a five minutes early. He was stunned to see the plush office and the humongous crowd of people working in it and everyone beaming with confidence. After some time Partho came to the front office area and told Debu that the boss was expecting him and wished him luck, Debu’s heart was pounding like a thousand turbine engines running in unison, coyly, he walked to the boss’s cabin and gave a soft knock on the door “come in” came the stern voice from inside he quietly walked in and wished. 
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>The cabin was bigger than his living room and was filled with the aroma of the mixture of coffee and expensive cologne, there were a few abstract pencil sketches on one of the walls and in the middle of the room sat a big executive table with leather upholstered chairs and on the executive chair was seated Mr. Pramod Mehta the Vice President of marketing division clad in an impeccably tailored suit with an hand crafted tie to compliment. 
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                      For a few seconds Debu could not help drooling over him. Mr. Mehta broke the ice by addressing a few welcome words and shortly the discussion got down to the brass tacks, questions were asked and the answers were given, Debu as mentioned earlier spoke quite eloquently, owing to his firm grip on communication skills. Mr. Mehta seemed to be impressed by Debu’s decorum and composure. He then gave away the details of the company, Debu learnt that the company bought tea on auction from various tea gardens in Darjeeling and Assam, The Company had its processing facility at Dibrugarh in Assam and they were exporting processed tea to over fifty countries in the world with a hefty annual turnover. The company now was looking forward to span its wings in the domestic market too and that’s precisely why Debu was there. His work domain was to appoint stockiest for their product. After the round of interview and discussion Mr. Mehta asked Debu to check with Partho regarding his selection and emoluments in two days time. After the interview Debu went back to his chosen spot at the park near Eden Garden which was not too far from there. Debu was convinced that he would get the job. Two days went in a jiffy and Partho called up Debu at convey that he has been selected for the post of Asst Manager (Marketing). Debu’s happiness knew no bounds but the only thing which was flogging him inside was Anirbaan’s thought. He thought had been around he would have been the first one he would have broken the news to but unfortunately, life had not been compassionate to hapless Anirbaan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      That day Debu reached home quite early and broke the news to the folks at home, after hearing what he had to say they looked more than relieved, it was evident in their eyes as if the quest was over. The date of joining soon came for Debu and he was to report to the General Manager (Marketing). His job involved a lot of touring to different smaller and bigger parts of the country and within a short stint he was able to establish the product well in the market with the highest market share in the rural market. He worked thoughtfully and diligently and he conceptualized and implemented a few more successful sales verticals. In just about two years Debu was seen as a blue eyed boy in the company and he was been give a further opportune of developing a few more international markets for which he travelled across the globe. Debu by now had become a confirmed corporate high flyer and a globe trotter with the bouquet of visas on his passport. He also managed to buy a sizable flat at a new plush locality Rajarhat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Life seemed like a bed of roses for Debu, he even managed to take the whole family for a world tour and it was during the tour in the midst of the panoramic beauty of Interlaken the adventure capital of Switzerland his father said with moisten eyes “I am proud of you my boy”, Debu was willing to die a thousand deaths to live up that moment. Life rolled on without glitches, and just the other day I met Debu in Delhi he had invited me for dinner at the Taj and we both together time travelled to those days at Rehmaan chacha’s tea stall remembering the band of unemployed friends, of which even I also was an integral part, but one thing was conspicuous that Anirbaan’s memory was inextirpable in the mind of Debu.
